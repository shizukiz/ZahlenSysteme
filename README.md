## Example
Let's take a look at a typical example of my clumsy calculations:

### Decimal to Binary Conversion

Input: 25

Step 1: Divide 25 by 2
```plaintext
25 ÷ 2 = 12 with a remainder of 1
``` 
Step 2: Divide 12 by 2
```plaintext
12 ÷ 2 = 6 with a remainder of 0
```
Step 3: Divide 6 by 2
```plaintext
6 ÷ 2 = 3 with a remainder of 0
```
Step 4: Divide 3 by 2
```plaintext
3 ÷ 2 = 1 with a remainder of 1
```
Step 5: Divide 1 by 2
```plaintext
1 ÷ 2 = 0 with a remainder of 1
```
The binary representation of 25 is obtained by reading the remainders from the last step in reverse order:
```plaintext
25 (decimal) = 11001 (binary)
```
As you can see, even a simple decimal to binary conversion can lead me down a path of confusion and clumsy calculations. So, join me in this lighthearted journey through the realm of numbers, where mistakes are celebrated, and laughter is guaranteed!
